# MonkeyOS

This is a toy OS with very little functionality. I'm using it to learn a bit about OS development.

## Source Tutorials

There were some tutorials I went through online that helped with the creation of this code.

* [os-tutorial by cfenollosa](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial)
* [OSDev Meaty Skeleton](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton)
* [The little book about OS development by Erik Helin, Adam Renberg](https://littleosbook.github.io/)

## Prerequisites

A few packages need to be installed as well as setting up a gcc cross-compiler. OSDev's [Bare Bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) tutorial can help with environment setup.

## How to run

Scripts to help run are in scripts folder. 

Once everything's setup, then to run:

```
./scripts/qemu.sh
```

And to cleanup:

```
./scripts/clean.sh
```
